Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.

A palindrome is a word or sentence that’s spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

Note. You’ll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything lower case in order to check for palindromes.

We’ll pass strings with varying formats, such as <b>“racecar”</b>, <b>“RaceCar”</b>, and <b>“race CAR”</b> among others.
